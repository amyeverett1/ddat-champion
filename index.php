            <p>The Digital, Data and Technology roundtables are informal face to face sessions with the DDaT senior management team.</p>

<p>They are an opportunity for relaxed ‘get to know you and your work’ conversations with colleagues and senior managers who you might not usually meet in your day to day activities and to help build wider awareness, understanding and collaboration across DDaT. We may also theme some of the conversations to address key or topical subjects.</p>

<p>Sessions will be co-hosted by senior managers and take place across our various locations on a quarterly basis.</p>

<p>All sessions are open to everyone across DDaT (subject to business commitments) and <strong>places must be booked through this app</strong>. Tickets are available on a first come first served basis and waiting lists will be in operation. You are not expected to travel specifically to attend a session; further roundtables will be held at each site on a rolling basis so there will be plenty of opportunities to attend throughout the year. Roundtables will not be used as a channel to announce any major updates – if required, such information would be shared in the usual ways with all staff. </p>

<p>Once you have booked a place this will be considered as your commitment to attend. Calendar appointments and reminders will be sent out before the date but <strong>please keep revisiting this app for the latest updates</strong> or changes to the agenda.</p>
